    <h2> Wedding Event </h2>
    <p> A wedding is a ceremony where two people or a couple are united in marriage. 
        Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes. 
        Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by the couple, presentation of a gift, 
        and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant. 
        Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception. 
        Music, poetry, prayers or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony.

    <blockquote><q>Neither man nor woman is perfect or complete without the other. Thus, no marriage or family, 
                 no ward or stake is likely to reach its full potential until husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, 
                 men and women work together in unity of purpose, respecting and relying upon each other's strengths.
